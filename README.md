## File table
All gcode files are in the [Releases](https://github.com/timothyjryan/jcrmrg-3d-faceshields/releases).
Cura project files and gcodes are zipped, but Cura projects can also be found in the projects directory.
The gcodes are set up as releases due to file size restrictions (the gcode files are pretty big).
