# jcrmrg-3d-faceshields
## Overview
Jersey City Rapid Makers Response Group - 3D printing files for faceshields  
The JCRMRG is printing faceshields for the local medical establishments to help bolster supplies.

---

### Additional Information
These faceshields can be printed on most 3d printers.  **Please be aware that gcode may not work on, and may possibly damage, other printers**.

## Faceshield Models
[Verkstan](https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013306)  
[Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/)

## File table
All gcode files are in the [Releases](https://github.com/timothyjryan/jcrmrg-3d-faceshields/releases).
Cura project files and gcodes are zipped, but Cura projects can also be found in the projects directory.
**Please be sure that different files have different major version numbers (v1.x, v2.x, etc.).
This is not exactly how versioning should be used, but it will be the easiest to maintain for our purposes.**
The gcodes are set up as releases due to file size restrictions (the gcode files are pretty big).
Please pay attention to the bed size, material type and nozzle size when using Cura projects from this repository.
